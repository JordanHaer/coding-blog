React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this blog post, I will document my journey of learning React. I began by understanding components, JSX syntax, and the virtual DOM concept. Then, I explored state management with React hooks and learned how to handle user input through forms and controlled components.

Additionally, I discovered the power of React's ecosystem, including libraries like React Router and Redux. React empowered me to build reusable and modular UI components efficiently.
