# Building Dynamic Web Apps with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful framework for building server-rendered React applications. In this blog post, I will discuss my journey of learning Next.js. I started by understanding the basics of server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) offered by Next.js. I explored Next.js's routing capabilities and learned how to fetch data from APIs. Additionally, I leveraged the benefits of Next.js's file-based routing and dynamic routes to create scalable and SEO-friendly applications. Next.js provided me with the tools to build performant and production-ready web apps.
