Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that simplifies the process of styling web applications. In this blog post, I will share my experience of learning Tailwind CSS. I discovered the power of utility classes and how they enable rapid development without writing custom CSS.

I explored the responsive design features, such as breakpoints and responsive grids, to create mobile-friendly layouts. Additionally, Tailwind CSS's extensive customization options allowed me to tailor the styles to match my project's requirements.
