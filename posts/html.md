In this blog post, I will share my journey of learning HTML. I started with the basics of tags, elements, and attributes. Then, I delved into structuring web pages with headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.

It was fascinating to learn about semantic HTML and the importance of proper markup. I also explored forms, tables, and multimedia integration. Overall, HTML forms the foundation of every web page, and I enjoyed the process of understanding its structure and purpose.
